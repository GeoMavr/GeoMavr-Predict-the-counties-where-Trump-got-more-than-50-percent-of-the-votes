This repository is a assignment project during my Msc in Business Analyitcs.
The data refer to the elections for the candidates of both parties (Democrats and Republicans) for the presidential election of 2016. The data are given in twosheets. The one file has the socioeconomic characteristics of the counties and the second one the votes for the candidates.We want to create a model using as response whether Trump got more than 50% of the votes at each county for the Republicans, using as explanatory variables the socio-economic characteristics of the counties.
